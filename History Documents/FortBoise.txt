Fort Boise was built by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1834 as a fur-trading outpost. Its name comes from the French word "boise," meaning "wooded." That's because there are lots of trees here, unlike the dry region of the Snake River Plain to the east. An important stop on the Oregon Trail, it stands on the banks of the Boise River, a tributary to the Snake River.
