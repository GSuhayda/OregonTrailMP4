Fort Kearney is a U.S. Army post established in 1848 near the Platte River. It garrisons cavalry troops who protect settlers and travelers along the Oregon Trail. It was named for Gen. Stephen Kearny (often spelled 'Kearney'), who died in 1848 after helping establish law and order in the region and serving in the Mexican War.
