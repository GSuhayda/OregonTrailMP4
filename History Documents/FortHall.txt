Fort Hall is an outpost on the banks of the Snake River. It was originally a Wyeth in 1834. Later it was bought by the Hudson's Bay Company. Ever since it has served as an important stop along the Oregon Trail, where emigrants can rest and buy supplies. Some travelers turn southwest at this point and head for California.
