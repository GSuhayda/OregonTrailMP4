Fort Walla Walla was established in 1818 as a fur-trading post at the juncture of the Columbia and Walla Walla Rivers. It later became a military fort. Marcus Whitman worked as a medical missionary nearby from 1836 to 1847. Walla Walla is the name of an American Indian tribe living in the region. The Walla Wallas are close related to and allied with the Umatila.
