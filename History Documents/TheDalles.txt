The Dalles is the chief embarkation point for rafts heading down the Columbia River toward the Willamette Valley. It was named by French fur-trappers, who likened the deep, stony river gorge to a huge gutter. (In French, the word 'dalles' can refer to 'gutters' or 'flagstones.') Emigrants to Oregon often stop here to rest and trade before rafting down the Columbia.
