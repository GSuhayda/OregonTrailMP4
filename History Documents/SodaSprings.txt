Soda Springs is an important landmark and stopping-off point along the trail. It gets its name from the alkaline (sodium) mineral springs you find there. Some travelers separate from the Oregon Trail at this point and head southwest for California. Others wait until they get to Fort Hall before going on the "California Trail”.
