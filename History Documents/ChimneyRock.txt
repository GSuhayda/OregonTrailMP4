Chimney Rock is an important landmark on the Oregon Trail. It's a spectacular natural formation of solid rock and can be seen from miles around. In fact, you can see it for a whole day as you approach it and another whole day as you leave it behind. If you don't see it at all within a week or so after leaving Fort Kearney, you've probably strayed too far off the trail
